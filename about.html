<h1>About the ERN Institute</h1>
<p class="subtitle">
        The ERN Institute (Experience-Related Neuroplasticity Institute) is an independent
        research and thought center dedicated to understanding how life experiences
        shape the brain and cognition across the lifespan.
      </p><p class="muted">Status: currently operating as an independent initiative; institutional partnerships and additional programs will be announced as they come online.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
        Our mission is to advance rigorous, integrative science on how experiences—from
        bilingualism and education to health events and training—remodel neural systems
        and cognitive function over time. We aim to connect basic research to applications
        in education, health, aging, and technology.
      </p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
        We envision a scientific landscape in which experience-related neuroplasticity is
        measured precisely, modeled mechanistically, and used to inform interventions
        that promote resilience, cognitive reserve, and wellbeing across diverse
        populations.
      </p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conduct and disseminate research on experience-related brain and cognitive change.</li>
<li>Develop and refine measures of experiential exposure and individual differences.</li>
<li>Provide methodological expertise in meta-analysis, EEG, and cognitive measurement.</li>
<li>Collaborate with academic, clinical, and industry partners on applied projects.</li>
<li>Support scholarly publishing and open science via ERNPress and the ERN journal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leadership &amp; Scientific Direction</h2>
<div class="card">
<h3>John G. Grundy, Ph.D., FPsyS.</h3>
<p class="muted">
          Director, ERN Institute · Cognitive neuroscientist specializing in experience-related
          neuroplasticity, bilingualism, cognition, and aging.
        </p>
<p>
          Dr. Grundy’s research examines how experience reorganizes attention, cognitive control,
          and brain function across the lifespan, with particular emphasis on bilingualism,
          neuroplasticity, and cognitive reserve. His work spans behavioral studies, EEG/MRI neuroimaging, and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis).
        </p>
<p>
          The ERN Institute serves as the scholarly home for this program of research and its
          collaborations across academic, health, and technology partners.

  <h3>Febriana Grundy, Ph.D. (expected 2026)</h3>
  <p class="muted">
    Associate Director, ERN Institute · Applied linguistics, corpus linguistics, second language development, and AI-assisted writing research.
  </p>
  <p>
    Febriana Grundy’s research focuses on the use of corpus linguistics methods to study learner language, academic and disciplinary writing, and second language development. Her work examines how linguistic experience, instructional context, and technology shape writing development across educational settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    She also investigates project-based language learning (PBL) and the intersections of artificial intelligence, writing, and language learning, with particular attention to pedagogical applications, assessment, and research methodology.
