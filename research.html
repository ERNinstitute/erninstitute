<p class="subtitle">
        Our research program investigates how experience shapes the brain and cognition, with
        emphasis on bilingualism, cognitive control, neural efficiency, and aging. We integrate
        behavioral paradigms, EEG and neuroimaging, and quantitative methods to understand
        mechanisms of experience-related neuroplasticity.

<h2>Core Research Streams</h2>
<h3>Bilingualism &amp; Cognitive Control</h3>
<p>
            Investigating how managing multiple languages influences attention, conflict
            monitoring, and executive function, and how these effects depend on patterns of
            language use and exposure.
          </p>
<h3>Neuroplasticity &amp; Aging</h3>
<p>
            Studying how long-term experiences, including bilingualism and cognitively
            demanding life contexts, contribute to cognitive reserve and the timing of
            age-related decline and dementia symptoms.
          </p>
<h3>Neural Efficiency &amp; Signal Complexity</h3>
<p>
            Examining changes in brain signal complexity, efficiency, and dynamics as markers
            of experience-related reorganization and adaptation.
          </p>

<h3>Methods &amp; Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>Behavioral tasks assessing attention, control, and decision-making</li>
<li>Electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs)</li>
<li>Neuroimaging collaborations</li>
<li>Meta-analysis and quantitative synthesis</li>
<li>Measurement development (e.g., continuous experience metrics)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">
            The Institute emphasizes robust measurement, reliability, and transparent analytic
            workflows to support cumulative science.
